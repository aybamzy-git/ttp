            <p>Well, as a teenager, growing up with a single mother could be difficult, both on me and my mum. 
                None of my parents are dead, but they just don't live together. I live with my mum. She pays the bills and she takes care of my brothers and I. 
            </p>
            <p>It really used to hurt that I did not have a dad, but then I realized that, my mum was my dad too. She did all that she could to love me so much, that it would not hurt so much that I did not have a dad. </p>
            <p>But now, I still think about him not being here and it doesn't really hurt anymore.</p>
