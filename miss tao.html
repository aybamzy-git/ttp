            <p>I started everything in 2015, when I wanted to learn how to edit videos. So, in order to learn how to edit, I had to get clips of myself. 
                So, I was determined to get better. I had challenges along the way. Coming up with stories was quite difficult for me because writing stories took a lot of time and energy. Another challenge I had was merging my school work and comedy together. 
                I would go home on weekends to shoot videos, then go back to school and study. And while studying, I had to edit my videos as well. 
                Learning how to do it and shooting the videos were not really hard, because I always had people to help and support me.
                I had to learn how to multitask and I'll just say, it was not easy. 
                Achieving success does not have to be hard. Just take advantage of what is available to you, and do.
                But on the long run, I feel fulfilled, with everything that is happening, and I'm happy with the way everything is turning out. 
                I'm really grateful for everything.
