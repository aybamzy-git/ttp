        <div class="story"><p>
            One day, I was just watching and listening to my female classmates as they were talking about what they've done with boys in the past. My friend joined the conversation and I felt odd and left out because I had not done any of those things before.</p>
            <p>They started making fun of me and I was embarrassed. They said that I was cute and they made me feel like I didn't know anything. So, they convinced me to kiss a boy that I did not even really like. They planned everything and, I did it. I felt empty after doing it, but my classmates were hailing me and stuff, and it felt good. I was feeling cool. 
            </p>
            <p>It really felt good feeling among and being in the spotlight. But, I regret doing what I did. I felt empty and guilty inside. Then I learnt that I did not have to do what everybody was doing. Just do what's right, no matter how many people are making fun of you.</p>
