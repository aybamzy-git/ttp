        <div class="story">
            <p>So when my sister was born in 2009, an uncle of mine came to live with us,and he used to write songs. He was like an older brother to me, so I wanted to do everything he did. My dad used to rap as well, so I believe that's what got me started really. Then in 2011, I started uploading acapellas to YouTube.</p>
            <p>I faced many challenges when I was just starting out. At the very beginning, my writing ability was not all that spectacular. I had talent, but I was very young so I had to develop the talent that I had. </p>
            <p>Another challenge that I had was that I did not know how to record. I was just playing beats off YouTube and recording myself singing over them with my phone.</p>
            <p>I got to learn about copyright and how I couldn't monetize any music with a beat that isn't mine. And since I had no capital, I had to learn to make beats, learn to record professionally, and so on.</p>
            <p>With all the challenges, it was not easy. I could have given up, but I didn't. The truth is overnight success doesn't exist. You keep at it. With all of it, I decide to stay independent, because I have learnt how shady record labels can be. It won't be easy to just become known. You have to work and keep at it.
