        <div class="story"><p>My teenage years are filled with the things that I should have done and the things I shouldn't have done, just like a normal teenager trying to find his way.
             I think one of the stories that comes to mind when I think of my teenage years is my time in the studio, as a teenager.
            I started going to the studio preety early and I remember being in the studio with many musicians and they were always making music.
            I felt like I had a different idea/opinion on how the music should be made.
            But I had a few challenges: firstly, I was considered too young to contribute to what they were doing. Secondly, nobody knew me as a producer. Even if I said I was, I did not think that anyone would believe me.
            And so, I was just there. I still did not agree with a number of things in terms of how they went about the production of their songs, and even now, as a grown up, I still don't think that was the best way to do it. 
            <p>I remember at a point, they bought me bread and Fanta, and they went out to have pounded yam. After some time, they came back and were telling me how sweet it was. 
               Meanwhile, as they were gone, I was in the studio just doing my own thing. (In Nigeria, West Africa, bread and Fanta is considered a snack and pounded yam is a rare delicacy.)
            </p>
            <p>So a time came, I finally had a chance to express myself, but the way I let go was vicious. I was stifled. I held back. I wanted to give it my all. I wanted to make a strong impression because one of the reasons why I wasn't allowed to express myself was because I was thought of as too young.
               Don't think that you are too young to have an opinion. It might not be the right opinion, but you have to voice it out as politely as possible. I would think of this experience as life-changing, because it made me yearn for the opportunity to produce.
            </p>
            <p>Your time will come. And when you realize that your time has come, one of the things that will propel you towards excellence is when you remember the times that you did not have that opportunity. So when you have it, you would not want to blow it. You would want to make the best out of it. It will give you the sense of what an opportunity is and how to take advantage of that opportunity. 
            </p>
            <p>I had a lot of challenges and some of them stemmed from culture. So, the general assumption is that young people and women are to be seen but not heard and I suffered that to some degree.
                I was a young person with a bit of a mouth and because of that, people called me proud.
            </p>
            <p>I encourage young people to speak out, but to do it with respect and consideration towards other people. 
                Don't be stifled because you think that you are too young, because in the process, you are killing your voice, which is bad for you.
                The best time to build your voice is as a young person because you are ignorant to an extent, and they have that lack of fear. 
                Not everything that you say might be right, but you must use your voice, with respect.
            </p>
